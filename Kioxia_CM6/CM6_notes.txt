Update utility specifically supports these models:
KCM61VUL1T60
KCM61VUL3T20

I suspect the binaries will work on a few more CM6 models with 010* firmware naming. (base model, NOT SED OR FIPS models)
(I don't have any CM6 drives on hand but I think this firmware will be useful for a few members on this forum.)
Binaries were extracted from a Lenovo update utility for China-only servers.
Original file name: "lnvgy_fw_drives_all-3.06.11-cfc_linux_x86-64.bin"

0105.ftd & 0106.ftd are the actual firmware binaries.
