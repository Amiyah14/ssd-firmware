 GXA5 firmware is for samsung PM1643a, is it compatible with samsung PM1643 ?e

probably not, the „a“ means a new hardware revision with changes in NAND and/or controller, eg. The pm983a uses 96-layer tlc v-nand instead of 64-layer

and please use a forum, like servethehome or others to ask questions
