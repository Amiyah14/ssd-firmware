3.   Linux Operating System

 

Note: The following procedure is for Red Hat Linux, please use microcode file 
packagePM985-MN3B-LINUX.tgz for Ubuntu

tar -C-xzvf PM985-MN3B-LINUX.tgz


Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM Power LE

 

3.1 Determine the Current Microcode Level for Linux:

These steps assume you are logged in with root permissions.

 

Prerequisites for Red Hat Linux:

Use the ibm-power-repo to configure the repositories and then use yum to 
download the nvme-cli package.

http://www14.software.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/lopdiags/home.html

 

1. Download the IBM Linux on Power Tools Repository configuration RPM file 
available at:

http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/lopdiags/yum.html

 

2. Copy the file to the target system and install the RPM

# rpm -ivh ibm-power-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

 

3. To add the Tools Repository to the package management configuration, run 
the following command as root user (or with root privilege) and accept the 
Licensing agreement.

# /opt/ibm/lop/configure

 

Instructions for installing nvme-cli tool using Red Hat Enterprise Linux

 

To list the currently enabled repositories, enter:

# yum repolist enabled

 

Install the nvme-cli package, enter:

# yum install nvme-cli

 

After nvme-cli is installed on the system, to check the current microcode 
level for the adapter enter the following command:

# nvme list

 

Note: "nvme list" command uses libudev-devel, if it doesn't work, may need to 
install ?libudev-devel"

 

1) Type "nvme list"
 2) The column ?FW Rev? will list the firmware version.  For example:

 
     Node                            SN                                  
Model                            Namespace                 
Usage                        Format              FW Rev 

----------------     
-----------------------   -----------------------------------------     
------------     -----------------------------      ----------------     ------ 
-------

/dev/nvme1n1    S434NY0K400206  800GB NVMe Gen3 U.2 Slim SSD           1
          800.17  GB / 800.17  GB      4 KiB +  0 B     REV.MN3B

 

If the Firmware Version is below than MN3B then you should update the 
microcode.

3.2 Downloading and Unpacking the Firmware Update Package

1. Download feature code EC5J/EC5K/EC5L package from FixCentral, and transfer 
the file, to a temporary directory on the target server such as /tmp.

2. Unpack the package

     rpm -ivh --ignoreos PM985-MN3B-LINUX.rpm

3. The microcode package extracts the firmware file to 
the /lib/firmware/ directory

 

3.3 Verifying microcode before download and notes

NOTE: Microcode download must be performed separately for each nvme under 
distinct Logical Partitions (LPAR's).
               Please save current and older versions of the microcode update 
files in case you need to restore your system.

 Please verify the file size and checksum of the raw microcode files matches 
the below.
Filesize:  1376256
 Checksum:  54242
 For Linux:  "ls -l /lib/firmware/ A1800101.4d4e3342" to verify Filesize.
                     "sum /lib/firmware/A1800101.4d4e3342" to verify Checksum.

For systems that have LPAR installed, the microcode file must be placed on 
all partitions that have(owns) an NVMe device in order to update the code.  
 Follow this procedure for each partition:
     

1.       Log into the target partition.

2.       Type: "cd /lib/firmware"

3.       SFTP to the partition that has the media bay assigned. (ie.  
"sftp partition1.ibm.com")

4.       Type: "cd /lib/firmware"

5.       Type: "get A1800101.4d4e3342"

6.       Type: "quit"

3.4 Microcode Download Procedure-NVMe Adapters for Linux

 1) Type "nvme list" and press "Enter".  This will list all of the NVMe
 adapters in your partition.  In the Node column, the NVMe adapters will be 
listed as /dev/nvme#n1 where # is the number of the device.
 2) For each NVMe adapter to be update, issue the following commands:

a)     Type ?nvme fw-log /dev/nvme<#>? and press ?Enter?, where <#> is the 
number of the device. 

                For example, for device /dev/nvme0n1, type 

                ?nvme fw-log /dev/nvme0? and press ?Enter?.  This will list 
the firmware level currently loaded on the adapter as well as the number of 
slots in the adapter.  
               These 3 slots are listed as frs1, frs3.

       b)     Download and activate firmware to the adapter by typing:

               Note that there are 4 FW ?slots? in this nvme, each slot must 
be updated AND activated, example below is for nvme0

 

nvme fw-download /dev/nvme0 --fw=/lib/firmware/ A1800101.4d4e3342

nvme fw-activate /dev/nvme0 -a 0 ?s 1

                                

Repeat for all slots (-s 2; -s 3)

 

 

nvme fw-activate /dev/nvme0 -a 3 ?s 3   ß this step may be omitted if the nvme
 device does not support the function

nvme reset /dev/nvme0
